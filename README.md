That's a smaller and efficient password validator.

 
## What the Application Does
- Validates passwords from an API;
- The application is launched via the comand line and accepts parameters if you want to change the API port;
- All validations are separate Regex so that they are easy to understand;
- Each validation has its own dedicated unit test.

## Explanation About Architecture and Design Patterns
About the Semaphore and Channels pattern in Golang:

- Validations are separete and done asynchronously;
- A channel is a way of sharing information between threads;
- In this case, I need to tell the application which validations have already passed;
- Once all the validations have passed, that's where the Semaphore pattern is applied;
- It is the only way to tell the application that asynchronously everything has been done;
- The validations are async and the request is blocking, because at the first failure of whatever validation, the application cuts off the request.

## About the Project

This project, have academic work purpose only.

He uses theses validations:
- 9 or more characters
- At least one number
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one special character, which can be: !@#$%^&*()-+
- No duplicate characters

Example:

- IsValid("") // false  
- IsValid("aa") // false  
- IsValid("ab") // false  
- IsValid("AAAbbbCc") // false  
- IsValid("AbTp9!foo") // false  
- IsValid("AbTp9!foA") // false
- IsValid("AbTp9 fok") // false
- IsValid("AbTp9!fok") // true

## Getting Started ðŸš€ 
First of all, install Golang 1.16 or higher version, because he is required.
Than, you can clone repo and run:
``` bash
go run main.go api
```
Or, import this package and use on your application with:
``` bash
go get github.com/wy7-source/pass-legitimator
```
<br>

## Docker-way to Getting Started :whale:
You also can use the official image to run the API on a isolated container:
```bash
docker run -p 9000:9000 wy7images/pass-legitimator:latest	
```
So send the password over POST to validate on *localhost:9000/validate* with this body:
```bash
  {
      "value": "AbTp9!fok"
  } 
  ```

And, the response will seems like that:
```bash
{
    "message": "true"
}
```
